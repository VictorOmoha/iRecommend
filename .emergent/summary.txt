The AI engineer successfully initiated the i-Recommend app development. Initially, it planned for Emergent Authentication, but the user requested a standard username/password system, which was then implemented using JWT. The backend received significant updates for auth, post management, and social features. The frontend saw the creation of core navigation, auth screens, room/post creation UIs, and a feed. A light/dark mode theme system was also integrated. Recently, issues with the Create Account button and the feed loading state were addressed, including the implementation of mock data. The latest problem is that these mock posts are not displaying on the user's phone, indicating a rendering or data loading problem despite the mock data being in place. The AI is currently debugging this display issue.

<product_requirements>
The i-Recommend app is a cross-platform mobile social media platform for sharing and discovering recommendations. Key MVP features include: User Profiles (username, avatar, bio, links, follower/following counts), Rooms (user-created category tabs for posts), Recommendation Posts (photo/video, title, description, tags, link, recommend/do not recommend toggle, action type), a Feed Page (followed users' recommendations), Social Interaction (like, comment, repost, share), Trending Page (engagement-based top posts), and Direct Messaging (1:1 text/images). Authentication was initially Emergent Auth, then switched to standard username/password with JWT. The UI is visual-first (Instagram-like cards), fast vertical scrolling (Twitter-like), with Dark and Light modes, and color-coded Room tabs. The tech stack utilizes React Native with Expo (specifically expo-router for file-based routing), a FastAPI backend, MongoDB for data storage, and Socket.io for real-time interactions. The goal is an MVP supporting posting, browsing by Room, feed viewing, liking/commenting, and messaging. Current implementation covers authentication, basic profile, room/post creation UI, and mock data for feed/trending.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: Expo React Native, expo-router, React Navigation, Zustand, @shopify/flash-list, react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view, expo-image-picker.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (Motor), bcrypt (for password hashing), PyJWT (for authentication), python-socketio.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based username/password authentication (initially Emergent Auth), session management.
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first design principles, light/dark mode theming, safe areas, keyboard handling.

<code_architecture>
The project has a clear monorepo-like structure with  and  directories.



-   ****: This is the core FastAPI backend. It handles user authentication (register, login, ), user profile management, room CRUD, and post CRUD operations. It also integrates with MongoDB for data persistence and  for password hashing, and  for token management. Initially set up with Emergent Auth, it was later refactored for standard username/password auth.
-   ****: The initial landing page of the application. It has undergone multiple changes, from an Emergent Auth login page to a simplified version to debug loading issues. It now includes Login and Create Account buttons.
-   ** & **: These files implement the new username/password login and registration forms. They are crucial for the standard authentication flow.
-   ****: Defines the bottom tab navigation structure for authenticated users, including Feed, Trending, Create, Rooms, and Profile tabs.
-   ****: Displays a list of recommendation posts. It was recently modified to include authentication headers for API calls, a loading timeout, empty state handling, and integration with .
-   ****: A placeholder for creating new posts/rooms.
-   ****: The user profile screen.
-   ****: Manages and displays user-created rooms.
-   ****: Screen for users to create new recommendation posts with image upload.
-   ****: Screen for users to create new rooms.
-   ****: Implements the light/dark mode logic using Zustand, managing the theme state and persistence. This file was recently simplified to resolve loading issues.
-   ****: Reusable component to display individual recommendation posts. Was recently debugged for rendering issues.
-   ****: Contains static mock data for posts, users, and rooms, used for populating UI during development, especially when the backend is not fully populated.

<pending_tasks>
- Fully implement the Add button functionality to navigate to post/room creation.
- Ensure all screens (Feed, Trending, Rooms, Profile) correctly display data from the backend once populated.
- Restore and integrate the full light/dark mode theme system seamlessly without causing loading issues.
- Resolve the issue where mock posts are not displaying on the user's phone, showing No posts yet.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing an issue where mock posts were not displaying on the user's phone, with the message No posts yet appearing on the feed screen.
The AI had already:
1.  Created  containing sample data for posts.
2.  Updated  to attempt to load this mock data and include authentication headers.
3.  Made temporary changes to  and  to debug frontend loading issues, resulting in a simpler, potentially temporary .
4.  Created a debug version of  to simplify rendering.

Despite these efforts, the mock data is still not rendering correctly. The last action was the AI checking expo logs to understand why the mock posts aren't displaying, following a screenshot that still showed a loading state. The backend is confirmed healthy, and authentication is working, so the issue is likely frontend rendering or data flow related within the feed component.

<optional_next_step>
Analyze expo logs to diagnose why mock posts aren't rendering on the feed screen.
